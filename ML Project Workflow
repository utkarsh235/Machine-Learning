ğŸš€ If you are starting with machine learning / deep learning and get a new dataset to work on, there are a few things you must always take care of:
ğŸ”¹ Look at the data carefully. Do EDA
ğŸ”¹ Look at the targets. See how they are distributed & what kind of problem this is
ğŸ”¹ Choose the right metric to evaluate your models
ğŸ”¹ Split the data into folds. You can use this for cross-validation or for hold out based validation
ğŸ”¹ Build a first basic model. This is going to be your baseline.
ğŸ”¹ Now try to improve on the baseline by adding new features
ğŸ”¹ To add new features, go back to data. Look at the EDA. That's why its quite important
ğŸ”¹ When you think you have reached a limit with feature engineering, try different models
ğŸ”¹ Keep log of all the scores, features and models
ğŸ”¹ When you think you have reached a limit with different models, try feature selection
ğŸ”¹ Done with feature engineering and feature selection? You will realize that by following above steps, you have also chosen a few best models that work well with your data
ğŸ”¹ Now its time to do hyperparameter optimization and squeeze the last few drops from your best models
ğŸ”¹ Wrap everything in docker, it's reproducible.
ğŸ”¹ Build a simple api endpoint or a fully-fledged web application to serve your model.
