🚀 If you are starting with machine learning / deep learning and get a new dataset to work on, there are a few things you must always take care of:
🔹 Look at the data carefully. Do EDA
🔹 Look at the targets. See how they are distributed & what kind of problem this is
🔹 Choose the right metric to evaluate your models
🔹 Split the data into folds. You can use this for cross-validation or for hold out based validation
🔹 Build a first basic model. This is going to be your baseline.
🔹 Now try to improve on the baseline by adding new features
🔹 To add new features, go back to data. Look at the EDA. That's why its quite important
🔹 When you think you have reached a limit with feature engineering, try different models
🔹 Keep log of all the scores, features and models
🔹 When you think you have reached a limit with different models, try feature selection
🔹 Done with feature engineering and feature selection? You will realize that by following above steps, you have also chosen a few best models that work well with your data
🔹 Now its time to do hyperparameter optimization and squeeze the last few drops from your best models
🔹 Wrap everything in docker, it's reproducible.
🔹 Build a simple api endpoint or a fully-fledged web application to serve your model.
